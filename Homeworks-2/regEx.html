        // TASK:
        // From a given string find and print all words. For us, a word must follow next specification:
        // 	1. Word is a string with at least 3 <word symbol> in it.
        // 	2. <word symbol> can be any of: Latin letters, dash, underscore and numbers.
        // 	3. A Word must start with a Latin letter.

        // Examples:
        // 	"this" is a word ('this' has more than 3 <word symbol>).
        // 	"know-how" is one word (by spec, the dash is a <word symbol>).
        // 	"1st" is NOT a word, because it doesn't start with letter!
        // 	"R2-D2" is a word, because it starts with letter!

        // TEST CASE:
        const testStr = `this is not meaningful.R2-D2 is a robot, first_second,1st of July`;

        // YOUR CODE HERE

        let regEx = /([a-z][0-9][-][a-z][0-9])|([a-z_]){3,}/gi;
        let words = testStr.match(regEx);
        words.forEach(el => console.log(el));

        // Without capturing the match.
        // Capturing is slow and memory consuming! If you need the parenthesis just for grouping- always use the ?: prefix.

        let regEx2 = /(?:[a-z][0-9][-][a-z][0-9])|([a-z_]){3,}/gi;
        let words2 = testStr.match(regEx);
        words2.forEach(el => console.log(el));


// EXPECTED OUTPUT:
// this
// not
// meaningful
// R2-D2
// robot
// first_second
// July

                <p>Christmas is an annual festival commemorating the birth of Jesus Christ, observed primarily on
                    December
                    25 as a religious and cultural celebration among billions of people around the world. A feast
                    central to
                    the Christian liturgical year, it is preceded by the season of Advent or the Nativity Fast and
                    initiates
                    the season of Christmastide, which historically in the West lasts twelve days and culminates on
                    Twelfth
                    Night. Christmas Day is a public holiday in many countries, is celebrated religiously by a majority
                    of
                    Christians, as well as culturally by many non-Christians, and forms an integral part of the holiday
                    season organized around it.

                    The traditional Christmas narrative, the Nativity of Jesus, delineated in the New Testament says
                    that
                    Jesus was born in Bethlehem, in accordance with messianic prophecies. When Joseph and Mary arrived
                    in
                    the city, the inn had no room and so they were offered a stable where the Christ Child was soon
                    born,
                    with angels proclaiming this news to shepherds who then spread the word.

                    Although the month and date of Jesus' birth are unknown, the church in the early fourth century
                    fixed
                    the date as December 25. This corresponds to the date of the winter solstice on the Roman calendar.
                    It
                    is exactly nine months after Annunciation on March 25, also the date of the spring equinox. Most
                    Christians celebrate on December 25 in the Gregorian calendar, which has been adopted almost
                    universally
                    in the civil calendars used in countries throughout the world. However, part of the Eastern
                    Christian
                    Churches celebrate Christmas on December 25 of the older Julian calendar, which currently
                    corresponds to
                    January 7 in the Gregorian calendar. For Christians, believing that God came into the world in the
                    form
                    of man to atone for the sins of humanity, rather than knowing Jesus' exact birth date, is considered
                    to
                    be the primary purpose in celebrating Christmas.</p>

                <p>A Christmas tree is a decorated tree, usually an evergreen conifer, such as a fir, spruce, or pine,
                    or an
                    artificial tree of similar appearance, associated with the celebration of Christmas, originating in
                    Germany associated with Saint Boniface. The custom was developed in medieval Livonia (present-day
                    Estonia and Latvia), and in early modern Germany where German Protestant Christians brought
                    decorated
                    trees into their homes. It acquired popularity beyond the Lutheran areas of Germany and the Baltic
                    governorates during the second half of the 19th century, at first among the upper classes.

                    The tree was traditionally decorated with "roses made of colored paper, apples, wafers, tinsel,
                    [and]
                    sweetmeats". Moravian Christians began to illuminate Christmas trees with candles, which were
                    ultimately
                    replaced by Christmas lights after the advent of electrification. Today, there is a wide variety of
                    traditional and modern ornaments, such as garlands, baubles, tinsel, and candy canes. An angel or
                    star
                    might be placed at the top of the tree to represent the Angel Gabriel or the Star of Bethlehem,
                    respectively, from the Nativity. Edible items such as gingerbread, chocolate, and other sweets are
                    also
                    popular and are tied to or hung from the tree's branches with ribbons. The Catholic Church had long
                    resisted this custom of the Lutheran Church and the Vatican Christmas tree stood for the first time
                    in
                    Vatican City in 1982. In the Western Christian tradition, Christmas trees are variously erected on
                    days
                    such as the first day of Advent or even as late as Christmas Eve depending on the country; customs
                    of
                    the same faith hold that the two traditional days when Christmas decorations, such as the Christmas
                    tree, are removed are Twelfth Night and, if they are not taken down on that day, Candlemas, the
                    latter
                    of which ends the Christmas-Epiphany season in some denominations.</p>

                <p>Santa Claus, also known as Father Christmas, Saint Nicholas, Saint Nick, Kris Kringle, or simply
                    Santa, is a legendary character originating in Western Christian culture who is said to bring gifts
                    on Christmas Eve of toys and candy to well-behaved children, and either coal or nothing to naughty
                    children. He is said to accomplish this with the aid of Christmas elves, who make the toys in his
                    workshop at the North Pole, and flying reindeer who pull his sleigh through the air.

                    The modern character of Santa is based on traditions surrounding the historical Saint Nicholas, the
                    English figure of Father Christmas and the Dutch figure of Sinterklaas.

                    Santa is generally depicted as a portly, jolly, white-bearded man, often with spectacles, wearing a
                    red coat with white fur collar and cuffs, white-fur-cuffed red trousers, red hat with white fur, and
                    black leather belt and boots, carrying a bag full of gifts for children. He is commonly portrayed as
                    laughing in a way that sounds like "ho ho ho". This image became popular in the United States and
                    Canada in the 19th century due to the significant influence of the 1823 poem "A Visit from St.
                    Nicholas". Caricaturist and political cartoonist Thomas Nast also played a role in the creation of
                    Santa's image. This image has been maintained and reinforced through song, radio, television,
                    children's books, family Christmas traditions, films, and advertising.</p>

                <p>A snowman is an anthropomorphic snow sculpture often built in regions with sufficient snowfall. In
                    many
                    places, typical snowmen consist of three large snowballs of different sizes with some additional
                    accoutrements for facial and other features. Due to the sculptability of snow, there is also a wide
                    variety of other styles. Common accessories include branches for arms and a rudimentary smiley face,
                    with a carrot used for a nose. Clothing, such as a hat or scarf, may be included. The low cost and
                    availability of materials mean snowmen are usually abandoned once completed. Snow becomes most
                    suitable
                    for packing when it approaches its melting point and becomes moist and compact. Making a snowman of
                    powdered snow is difficult since it will not stick to itself, and if the temperature of packing snow
                    drops, it will form an unusable denser form of powdered snow called the crust. Thus, a good time to
                    build a snowman may be the next warm afternoon directly following a snowfall with a sufficient
                    amount of
                    snow. Using more compact snow allows for the construction of a large snowball by simply rolling it
                    until
                    it grows to the desired size. If the snowball reaches the bottom of the grass it may pick up traces
                    of
                    grass, gravel, or dirt. In North America, snowmen are generally built with three spheres
                    representing
                    the head, torso, and lower body. In the United Kingdom, two spheres are used, one sphere
                    representing
                    the body and one representing the head. The usual practice is to then decorate and optionally dress
                    the
                    snowman. Sticks can be used for arms, and a face is traditionally made with stones or coal for eyes
                    and
                    a carrot for a nose. Some like to dress their snowmen in clothing such as a scarf or hat, while
                    others
                    prefer not to risk leaving supplies outdoors where they could easily be stolen or become stuck under
                    melting ice.</p>
